\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}In this report, we provide a broad overview of our compiler implementation along with more detailed explanations on some parts of the implementation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Tools}
\paragraph{}For some parts of the project, we have used external tools.

\paragraph{}For the lexical analysis part, we used Flex along with Bison. Specifically, Bison was used only to define the tokens used in Flex.\\
For the syntax analysis part, we continued to use Bison since we already used it for the lexical analysis part.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Organization of the code} \label{codeOrg}
\paragraph{}Our code is split in multiple files. The files are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{Makefile} is a Makefile to build the compiler by simply using the command \texttt{make}.
	\item \texttt{vsopc.l} is the file for the lexical analysis part using Flex.
	\item \texttt{vsopc.y} is the file for the syntax analysis part using Bison. It also contains the \texttt{main} function of the project.
	\item \texttt{*.cpp} and \texttt{*.hpp} are the implementation and header files for the possible tokens.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}The classes defined in the \texttt{*.cpp} and \texttt{*.hpp} files are organized in an inheritance-based approach using dynamic dispatch because, in our opinion, it is the most natural approach while using an object-oriented language as C++. The hierarchy of classes can be represented by the figure \ref{classHierarchy}.

\section{Modules' responsibilities}
\paragraph{}Most \texttt{*.hpp} files contain the headers associated to at least one sub-type of expression. For instance, the file \texttt{while.hpp} contains the header associated to the \texttt{while} construct.\\
For each \texttt{.hpp} file, there is an associated \texttt{.cpp} file with the same name containing the implementation of the header.

\paragraph{}As already explained, \texttt{vsopc.l} contains the rules for the lexical analysis with Flex and \texttt{vsopc.y} contains the rules for the syntax analysis with Bison along with the \texttt{main} function.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Data structures and algorithms}
\paragraph{}Regarding data structures, we mostly use \texttt{std::vector}s defined in C++ standard template library (STL).

\paragraph{}For algorithms, we do not make use of algorithms that require any additional explanations than what is provided as documentation in the various source files.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Implementation choices}
\paragraph{}We decided to use Flex and Bison due to the strong recommendations made during the first presentation of the project.\\
Since we chose Flex and Bison, we were limited to C or C++ as programming languages. We decided to use C++ because we thought that having classes would come handy and, in our experience, it is easier to work with strings in C++ compared to C, even thought we have more experience in C than in C++.
Finally, as already mentioned in section \ref{codeOrg}, we decided to use an inheritance-based approach because, in our opinion, it is the most natural approach while using an OO language such as C++.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Conflicts in the grammar}
\paragraph{}Our grammar does not contain any shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts.

\section{Time spent}
\paragraph{}Unfortunately, as we did not know that we would be asked the time spent at the end of the project, we did not keep track of it nor we can provide an approximation since we are always going back and forth between multiple projects specially with the integrated project.
